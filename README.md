# OBS Interactive Screen

OBS Studio allows users to share browser pages and apply custom CSS, enabling streamers to create interactive and visually engaging effects. Inspired by this feature, I developed OBS Interactive Screen at the request of a streamer friend who wanted a tool for real-time interaction during streams.

This project provides an interactive layer for OBS, allowing streamers to enhance their content with dynamic and customizable interactions. Whether you're looking to engage your audience or add creative effects, OBS Interactive Screen is here to help.
